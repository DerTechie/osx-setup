# Der Techie OSX setup
Contains files, information and guides to replicate my local OSX setup. Feel free to use the information
as you like.

## PHP Storm setup
As my main IDE I use PHP Storm. As Font I do use [SF Mono](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/). A great
alternative that I do like is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). On an 5120x2880 monitor I
have a font size of 13.5 and a line height of 1.2. This lets me open exactly two PHP code files side by side
with a line length of 120 characters.

As color Theme I use [phpstorm-light-lite-theme](https://github.com/brendt/phpstorm-light-lite-theme).
